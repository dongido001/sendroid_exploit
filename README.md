# Sendroid SMS PORTAL Exploit (<= 6.5.0)

A script to automatically inject the Sendroid Software to get admin password.

Submited Vulnerabilty to the Vendor, I believe this should be fixed now. If you are still using version less than or equal to 6.5.0, you should consider an upgrade because you might be affected.
