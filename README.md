# Sendroid SMS PORTAL Exploit (<= 6.5.0)

A script to automatically inject the Sendroid Software to get admin password

Submited Vulnerabilty to the Vendor, I believe this should be fixed now. If you are still using version less than or equal to 6.5.0, you should consider an upgrade becuase you might be affected.

## How to run the script

Open up your command prompt, then CD into the folder where you have the script - `sendroid_exploit.php`

Then Run the exploit as below:

> Note that the `url` must be a direct path to the folder where Sendroid software is installed.

When done you can login to the admininstrator panel:
